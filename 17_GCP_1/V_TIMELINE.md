* ~1960s: From user switching to the  mainframe task switching
    * 1 [Mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer) / 1000 users
    * 1 I/O operations were done at most sequentially
    * No time sharing / machine was idle most of time
    * Users entering data / computer processed tasks of another user 
    * 1954: Shown that rolled [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) glass allowed light to be transmitted
* 1967-1968: From processor task switching to virtual machine and hypervisor
    * [Hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) + [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) / [OS level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)
    * IBM created a new mainframe that supported [CP/CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/CMS)
    * Virtual machines share mainframe resources instead of using it one-by-one in their turn, so efficiency is higher
    * Every [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) is an exact copy of the original hardware, so you can run any OS on every single machine
    * Every user has his own OS, so he doesn't affect other users - the entire system becomes more reliable
